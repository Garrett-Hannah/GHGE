/*(C) GARRETT HANNAH - 2025
 *
 * Physics object class.
 *
 * what does it do?
 * Its essentially an extension of
 * our initial collision object class. (but it doesnt inherit from it)
 *
 * But we want some important things from this class, 
 * overall its most involved with kind of just holding
 * data for our engine to use.
 *
 * It will contain information,
 * mostly like the position of the object.
 *
 * but more importantly, stuff like mass, or any important parameters within.
